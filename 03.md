14. On the **Cryptography for CA** page, keep the default settings for CSP (**RSA#Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider**) and hash algorithm (**SHA256**), and determine the best key character length for your deployment. Large key character lengths provide optimal security; however, they can impact server performance and might not be compatible with legacy applications. It is recommended that you keep the default setting of 2048. Click **Next**.

15. On the **CA Name** page, keep the suggested common name for the CA or change the name according to your requirements. Ensure that you are certain the CA name is compatible with your naming conventions and purposes, because you cannot change the CA name after you have installed AD CS. Click **Next**.

17. On the **CA Database** page, in **Specify the database locations**, specify the folder location for the certificate database and the certificate database log. If you specify locations other than the default locations, ensure that the folders are secured with access control lists (ACLs) that prevent unauthorized users or computers from accessing the CA database and log files.
