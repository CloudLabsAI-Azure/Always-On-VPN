# Deploy Always On VPN - Set up infrastructure for Always On VPN

**Configure Remote Desktop Connection Manager**

As the very first task, Let us setup Remote Desktop Connection Manager so that we can RDP into all the Lab Servers (VMs).

> The Lab VM you are connected to, is the Domain Controller VM that we will be using throughout the Lab to connect to other VMs

- Download RDC Manager from this link in your Lab VM: <u>https://experienceazure.blob.core.windows.net/templates/always-on-vpn/labfiles/RDCMan.exe</u>

- Save the Downloaded File in **C:\LabFiles**
